## Developing AI models to support scientific discovery

I'm a PhD student at the University of Michigan developing simulation-grounded foundation models for scientific discovery. My research spans epidemiology, chemistry, and social science, with a focus on enabling interpretable and generalizable predictions.

My work includes:
- **SGNNs**: A general framework that uses mechanistic simulations as synthetic supervision to train neural networks for scientific tasksâ€”enabling forecasting, classification, and inference even when real-world data is sparse, noisy, or missing. SGNNs unify the interpretability of mechanistic models with the flexibility of deep learning, and introduce back-to-simulation attribution: a new form of mechanistic interpretability.
- **Mantis**: A foundation model for infectious disease forecasting that outperforms baselines across 35+ evaluations.
- **Optic**: A real-time disease surveillance system that combines simulation-pretrained detection models with robust anomaly and seasonality analysis. Optic achieves state-of-the-art outbreak detection accuracy and requires no disease- or region-specific trainingâ€”enabling immediate deployment in low-resource public health departments without tuning.

I'm currently focused on closing the loop between simulation and learning by developing methods that actively select which synthetic data to generateâ€”making the modeling process efficient, adaptive, and autonomous.
