## I build AI systems that accelerate science.

I'm a PhD student at the University of Michigan, developing simulation-grounded foundation models for scientific discovery. My research spans epidemiology, chemistry, and social science, with a focus on enabling mechanistically interpretable and generalizable predictions.

My work includes:
- **SGNNs**: A general framework using simulation as supervision across scientific domains.
- **Mantis**: A foundation model for infectious disease forecasting that outperforms baselines across 35+ evaluations.

I'm currently focused on closing the loop between simulation and learning by integrating active acquisition of synthetic data into the modeling pipeline.
