title: "Simulation as Supervision: Mechanistic Pretraining for Scientific Discovery"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/SGNNs
excerpt: 'Introduced Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a new modeling framework that uses mechanistic simulations to train neural networks, combining the interpretability of scientific theory with the flexibility of deep learning. SGNNs deliver state-of-the-art performance across disciplines—from forecasting epidemics to inferring hidden variables—while offering a novel form of mechanistic interpretability.'
